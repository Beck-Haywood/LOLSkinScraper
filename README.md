# ðŸ•· LOLSkinScraper

### Proposal

Scrapes the champion list page for each champion url, to make sure it has the most up to date champions.

Concurrently scrapes each champion cosmetic page @ https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Wiki.

Uses marshal indent to format the data into json and output it to file.
